/**
 * Defines a contract for the lookup, use, and release of a
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory},
 * or a {@code BeanFactory} subclass such as an
 * {@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext}.
 *
 * <p>Where this interface is implemented as a singleton class such as
 * {@link SingletonBeanFactoryLocator}, the Spring team <strong>strongly</strong>
 * suggests that it be used sparingly and with caution. By far the vast majority
 * of the code inside an application is best written in a Dependency Injection
 * style, where that code is served out of a
 * {@code BeanFactory}/{@code ApplicationContext} container, and has
 * its own dependencies supplied by the container when it is created. However,
 * even such a singleton implementation sometimes has its use in the small glue
 * layers of code that is sometimes needed to tie other code together. For
 * example, third party code may try to construct new objects directly, without
 * the ability to force it to get these objects out of a {@code BeanFactory}.
 * If the object constructed by the third party code is just a small stub or
 * proxy, which then uses an implementation of this class to get a
 * {@code BeanFactory} from which it gets the real object, to which it
 * delegates, then proper Dependency Injection has been achieved.
 *
 * <p>As another example, in a complex J2EE app with multiple layers, with each
 * layer having its own {@code ApplicationContext} definition (in a
 * hierarchy), a class like {@code SingletonBeanFactoryLocator} may be used
 * to demand load these contexts.
